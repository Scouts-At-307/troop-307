You can't have Scouting without "outing". The Outdoor Program is one of the principal features of Scouting that appeals to boys, and a week at Summer Camp is the highest experience.

Summer Camp 2018 will be June 19th to 25nd at [Camp Rainey Mountain](http://nega-bsa.org/camps/summer-camps/2013-rainey-mountain-summer-camp/) located in the mountains of North Georgia.

Please consider giving your son an experience that he will remember for a lifetime.
