You can't have Scouting without "outing". The Outdoor Program is one of the principal features of Scouting that appeals to boys, and a week at Summer Camp is the highest experience.

Summer Camp 2020 will be June 19th to 25th at [Camp Rainey Mountain](https://www.nega-bsa.org/crm/) located in the mountains of North Georgia.

Please consider giving your son an experience that he will remember for a lifetime.
