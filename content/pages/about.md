Troop 307 is a Boy Scout troop chartered by Saxe Gotha Presbyterian Church. We are located in Lexington, SC [on Sunset Boulevard](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Saxe+Gotha+Presbyterian+Church/). We meet on Mondays from 7:00 to 8:30 pm. For more information regarding our schedule, [visit the calendar page](calendar.html). If you'd like to learn more about the scouting program, visit the Boy Scouts of America website at [www.scouting.org](http://www.scouting.org). Our troop enjoys camping 11 months out of the year. In June, we visit Camp Rainey Mountain, a BSA summer camp located in the mountains of Northern Georgia. If you have any questions, please contact our [Scoutmaster](mailto:scoutmaster@scoutsat307.org).
